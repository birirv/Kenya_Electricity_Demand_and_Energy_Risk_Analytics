# Kenya Electricity Demand & Energy Risk Analytics

# Project Overview
This project analyzes Kenya's electricity sector from 2000 to 2024 focusing on historical demand patterns, generation trends, risk assessment and forecasting future consumption. 
Using IEA generation data and Our World in Data per capita energy consumption.
The project delivers actionable insights for policymakers, utilities and investors.

# Objectives
- Identify trends in electricity generation and per capita demand.
- Forecast future energy demand to 2030.
- Quantify risks: volatility, tail risks, and dependency on variable sources.
- Provide interactive dashboards and visualizations to support decision-making.
